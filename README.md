# Mach Eight Sample Project

## Tasks
The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.

## Considerations:
<li>You can assume that all input values are integers.</li>
<li>You can assume that there aren't any repeat values in the list.</li>
<li>The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2).</li>
<li> All edge cases should be handled appropriately.</li>

## Requirements
- SDK .NET 7.0

## How to use it
<li>Clone this repository into your machine: https://github.com/RobARC/MachEight_2023.git</li> 
<li>If SDK .NET 7.0 doesnÂ´t installed in your device download from here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0</li>
<li>Select your appropiate OS</li>
<li>Check if the installation was ok with this command : <b>dotnet --list-sdks</b></li>
<li>To run the program, go to the folder MachEightChallange and write this in your console: dotnet run 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12 (Or any other values, following the considerations above)</li>
<li>To run the tests go to the folder MachEightTests an write this command into your conole: <b>dotnet test</b></li>
